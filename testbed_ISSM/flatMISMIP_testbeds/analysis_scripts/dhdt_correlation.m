%% Thinning rate is correlated with...?
% In this script, we are exploring what correlates with the h(t). We
% previously thought that the calving front position is the best predictor,
% yet we see in our simulation that even if the calving front stablizes,
% the grounding line can keep retreating and this contributes to additional
% thinning.
%
% Then we hypothesize that the length of the floating section is the best
% predictor (which takes into account of both the calving front position
% and the grounding line position).
